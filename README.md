Data Analytics Projects

🚀 A collection of data analytics projects showcasing data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization using SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI.

📌 About This Repository
This repository contains various data analytics projects where I apply data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques to extract insights from raw datasets. Each project includes:

📊 Data Cleaning & Transformation – Using SQL, Python, and Excel to preprocess and structure data.
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends, patterns, and missing values.
📈 Visualizations & Dashboards – Creating meaningful reports for data-driven decision-making.
🛠 Tools Used – SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Excel, Power BI, and more.

📂 Projects Included
🌍 World Population Analysis
Analyzed global population trends using Python and Pandas.
Cleaned and processed raw data, handled missing values, and performed statistical analysis.
Created visualizations (heatmaps, box plots) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify key insights.

📞 Customer Data Cleaning
Processed a customer call list dataset using Pandas, standardizing names, phone numbers, and addresses.
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and split unstructured address data into structured fields.
Filtered "Do Not Contact" customers and optimized the dataset for further analysis.

🗃 SQL Data Cleaning & Exploration
Utilized SQL queries to clean and transform raw data for better usability.
Removed duplicates, corrected inconsistencies, and structured datasets for reporting.
Applied aggregation and filtering functions to identify trends and missing data patterns, ensuring data integrity.

📊 Excel Data Analysis
Conducted business data analysis using Excel, implementing pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and advanced formulas.
Filtered and aggregated large datasets to extract key insights and improve decision-making.
Created interactive reports and dashboards to visualize trends effectively.

📈 Power BI Data Analysis & Dashboard
Cleaned and transformed raw data in Power BI using Power Query, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and insights.
Designed an interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts, and drill-down reports for data-driven decision-making.
Utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures for advanced reporting.
